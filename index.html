  <h1> Reflection </h1>


<h3> Part 1 </h3>
<p> Something hard that I learned was using d3 and putting functions together with javascript, sepcifically the data transformation lab with the penguin data. Specifically the part C1 where the step by step instructions were not avaliable. In that problem, something clicked for me while having to create my own step by step procedure. I finally realized that javascript is a whole lot easier if you combine small things you know how to do and then modify them slightly to fit the problem. 
  
A lot of the problems I have with javascript are related to being scared to break the rules. Having to make up a procedure without the help of class notes to write the code forced me to learn to take more risks and figure out what general parts of the code format are meant to be changed and which ones need to stay.

<h3> Part 2 </h3> 
<p> 
Something hard in this class I haven't mastered yet is scrapping. Even though the marvel lab was cancelled, I'm still frustrated that I don't understand how it works. I understand that the point of scrapping is to get information from an external source/url and add it to a file so we can manipulate it later. The part I don't understand is how the code needs to be written. I think I'm struggling to understand what Nodejs does and how that fits into the picture. I know we need to write some sort of function but I don't know how to incorporate all the necessary commands. I've tried to come back and look at it again after learning a little more javascript but I'm still at a loss.
